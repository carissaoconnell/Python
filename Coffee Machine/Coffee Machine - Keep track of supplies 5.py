# Write a program that will work endlessly to make coffee for all interested 
# persons until the shutdown signal is given. Introduce two new options: 
# "remaining" and "exit".

# Do not forget that you can be out of resources for making coffee. 
# If the coffee machine doesn't have enough resources to make coffee, the program 
# should output a message that says it can't make a cup of coffee and state what is missing.

# And the last improvement to the program at this step â€” if the user types 
# "buy" to buy a cup of coffee and then changes his mind, they should be able 
# to type "back" to return into the main cycle.
